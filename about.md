The Theoretical Biology Reading Group meets monthly on the University of Illinois Chicago campus to discuss texts pertaining to fundamental issues in the life sciences.

Our formal training entails specialization in the techniques and worldview of a particular subdiscipline. We take a broader perspective; we interrogate new frameworks, reexamine old debates, and critique received views in evolution, ecology, development, physiology, and the history and philosophy of biology. We aim to ask new questions, or at least to ask old questions in new ways.

Our readings can be technical. A graduate-level familiarity with biology helps, but anyone is welcome as long as they have done the reading and agree to abide by our principles. Future readings are proposed and selected by a vote of participants at each meeting. Meeting times are available on our calendar. If you'd like to join, please RSVP here.
